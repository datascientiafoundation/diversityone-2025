The study followed ethical approval procedures in each of the participating institutions and is compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThe dataset contains questionnaire answers from over 18K students, 782 of whom agreed to participate in a longitudinal survey of four weeks. The study used the iLog app to collect data from smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, as well as derived information such as notification interactions, app usage, activities, and step counts. During this period, participants reported their activities, locations, social context, and mood, with daily reports on sleep quality and daily expectations.\nThe combination of sensor data and self-reported data across eight universities worldwide fosters research in ubiquitous computing, mobile sensing, machine learning, computational social science, and design with data. The dataset also opens the possibility for the design of new data-driven studies of diverse human behavior."
