The dataset combines questionnaires about demographic and psychosocial variables from 18K participants, and passive smartphone sensor data and self-reported annotation from 782 students across eight universities in eight countries. The study followed ethical approval procedures in each of the participating institutions and is compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This dataset is a rich, flexible and valuable research resource that can be used to answer research questions in multiple fields: machine learning, mobile sensing, computational social science, behavioral recognition, and many others. This challenge offers the opportunity to work on the dataset and gain useful feedback on your research. We welcome contributions from researchers from diverse backgrounds and geographical provenances."

The dataset paper describes in detail the dataset together with the data collection methodology and statistics. contains data from college students in eight countries: China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom. The study followed ethical approval procedures in each of the participating institutions and is compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The dataset contains questionnaire answers from over 18K students, 782 of whom agreed to participate in a longitudinal survey of four weeks. The study used the iLog app to collect data from smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, as well as derived information such as notification interactions, app usage, activities, and step counts. During this period, participants reported their activities, locations, social context, and mood, with daily reports on sleep quality and daily expectations. The combination of sensor data and self-reported data across eight universities worldwide fosters research in ubiquitous computing, mobile sensing, machine learning, computational social science, and design with data. The dataset also opens the possibility for the design of new data-driven studies of diverse human behavior."
