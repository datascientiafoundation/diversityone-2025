The open challenge aims to explore the *DiversityOne* dataset, one of
the largest and most geographically diverse smartphone datasets about
everyday life behavior. The dataset combines questionnaires about
demographic and psychosocial variables from 18K participants, and
passive smartphone sensor data and self-reported annotation from 782
students across eight universities in eight countries.

This dataset is a rich and valuable research resource that can be used to address research
questions in multiple fields: machine learning, mobile sensing,
computational social science, design with data, and many others. The
open challenge offers the opportunity to work on the dataset and gain
useful feedback on your research.

We welcome contributions from researchers from *diverse backgrounds and geographical provenances*. In
particular, we welcome contributions that address aspects including, but
not limited to:

-   **AI/ubiquitous computing/mobile sensing**

    -   data-centric AI
    -   interactive machine learning
    -   noisy annotation detection and correction
    -   domain adaptation
    -   transfer learning

## The dataset

To participate, you are expected to use the *DiversityOne* dataset. This
dataset is the result of the large-scale European project ["WeNet - The
Internet of US"](https://doi.org/10.3030/823783). The
[dataset paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3712289)
describes in detail the dataset together with the data collection
methodology and statistics. contains data from college students in eight
countries: **China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay**, and
the **United Kingdom**. The study followed ethical approval procedures in
each of the participating institutions and is compliant with the
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The dataset contains questionnaire answers from over 18K students, 782 of whom agreed to
participate in a longitudinal survey of **four weeks**. The study used the
[iLog app](https://datascientia.disi.unitn.it/ilog/) to collect
data from **smartphone sensors** such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS,
as well as derived information such as notification interactions, app
usage, activities, and step counts. During this period, participants
reported their **activities**, **locations**, **social context**, and **mood**, with
daily reports on **sleep quality** and **daily expectations**.

The combination of sensor data and self-reported data across eight universities
worldwide fosters research in ubiquitous computing, mobile sensing,
machine learning, computational social science, and design with data.
The dataset also opens the possibility for the design of new data-driven
studies of diverse human behavior.

## Paper submission

*Short paper (max 4 pages, excluding references)*. The submitted works
are expected to reflect on, analyze, or test the *DiversityOne* dataset.
Submitted papers should report the work's motivation, methodology,
results, possible future analyses, and include an ethical statement
describing potential societal impact.

The paper should follow the [UbiComp/ISWC template and guideline](https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2025/authors/formatting/).
All papers and any supplementary material must be **anonymized**. Each
submission will be reviewed by two reviewers from a panel of experts. All authors are asked
to adhere to the [Accessible Submission Guidelines](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/).

All accepted publications will be published on the ACM Digital Library
as part of the UbiComp 2025 proceedings. At least one author of each
accepted paper needs to register for the workshop. During the workshop,
each paper will be presented by one of the authors. We are exploring
with the conference and workshop chairs the possibility of supporting
video/remote presentations and reduced rates for authors unable to
travel to the conference to promote diversity and facilitate
participation.

## Paper presentation

The authors of the accepted paper will be invited to present their work
during the workshop. The presentation timing will be defined based on
the number of submissions (tentatively, the presentation will be between
10 minutes, with 5 minutes for Q/A and discussion, in which we encourage
participants to exchange ideas and approaches). The final timing will be
communicated before the workshop.

## Paper Awards

Papers will receive a special mention during the workshop in the form of
a best paper award and a best paper runner-up award. The evaluation will
be made by a committee based on the following criteria:

-   *creativity*: how original or novel the analysis is;
-   *multidisciplinary*: how well it combines ideas and approaches from
    multiple disciplines;
-   *presentation*: how clear the presentation is and how well written
    the paper is;
-   *impact*: how likely is it that the work can lead to impactful
    results if the paper is further extended.

## Extended version in journal

A selection of the accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended
version to [IEEE Pervasive Computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7756).

## How to get the datasets

1.  **Navigate the data catalog.** The catalog is available on the [data catalog]({{< var link.catalog >}}).
    Please look at the available datasets and documentation. The catalog
    contains

    -  basic _datasets_ (e.g., one single modality such as [accelerometer](https://datascientiafoundation.github.io/LivePeople-ws/datasets/2020-DiversityOne-Trento-Accelerometer/) or [annotations for one university](https://datascientiafoundation.github.io/LivePeople-ws/datasets/2020-DiversityOne-Amrita-Diachronic-Interactions/))
    -  _dataset bundles_ of basic sensors (e.g., [motion sensors](https://datascientiafoundation.github.io/LivePeople-ws/datasets/2020-DiversityOne-Copenhagen-Motion/) grouping accelerometer and step counter) split by data collection location.
    -  _projects_ grouping all data of one single university.
    
    Any composition of bundle, datasets and university project can be requested coherently with your research proposal.

2.  **Proposal submission.** All authors must submit a data download
    request through the web form that will be made available from _{{< var request_date >}}_ by providing the following information:

    -   Names and contact information of the authors working on the
        dataset and their institution.
    -   Description of the research proposal. Provide a description of
        your idea and how you plan to use the dataset.
    -   Select from a list the datasets to download. On the data
        catalog, you can find and navigate the list of downloadable
        datasets and navigate the codebooks.

    The key requirements to obtain a copy of the data are the affiliation
    with a research institution, either private or public, the coherence
    between the requested data and the research proposal, and the
    acceptance of the Terms and License Agreement. Key licensing terms include:

    - datasets are used exclusively for research purposes;
    -  redistribution of the datasets is prohibited;
    -  datasets cannot be publicly shared (e.g., on a website);
    -  any attempt to reverse engineer any portion of the data or to
        re-identify the participants is strictly forbidden and could
        constitute unlawful processing of personal data.

2.  **Dataset download.** The proposal request is evaluated by the
    University of Trento (UNITN), and in case of a positive response,
    the participants receive an email with the instructions for
    downloading the dataset after a few days. The requested data are
    shared with the participants through dedicated storage.

## Contacts

For any questions related to the workshop or technical support regarding
the datasets, please do not hesitate to reach out to the organizers at

## Examples of previous studies

Previous studies investigated various aspects of high-quality rich
datasets that include sensor data and self-reports. Some examples are:

- the use of social media [@giunchiglia2018mobile];

- cross-individual activity recognition [@shen2022federated]; 
- mood inference [@meegahapola2023generalization];
- diversity perceptions in a community [@kun2022];
- activity recognition [@bouton2022your];
- social context inference while eating [@kammoun2023understanding];
- inferring mood-while-eating [@bangamuarachchi2023inferring];
- the generation of contextually rich data with other reference datasets [@giunchiglia2024big].
